## Features
This addon adds the following features to a Volto site
- adds a controlpanel item for workflow manager
- shows available custom workflows and Plone-shipped workflows
- adds the ability to create/initialize a new workflow
- ability to clone from a workflow
- A UI mockup for an individual workflow management page with some working features.
- the ability to do a `sanity check` for a workflow's correctness.
- An interactive and based workflow graph of the Finite State Machine of the workflow
- ability to look and search for a state or transition in the graph
- deletion of a workflow.

## Future Roadmap
**As this is mere PoC, I haven't followed best Plone practices**, so stopping this here, however the next steps in this PoC would have been the following:

### Features
- ability to add new states, clone states with transitions
- Create transitions and complete flow pending. Support guards, permissions...
- Complete flow of assigning a workflow to a content-type
- edit individual states and transitions in-depth features
- Update Security feature
- delete states and transitions
  
### UI
- Create transitions from the graph by connecting 2 states
- Maybe make UI easier by adding common actions as special options on right-clicking on a state and transition
- Reorder Graph logic

## Installation

The easiest installation would be installing this repo and doing `make install` followed by a `pnpm start`.
Otherwise, add this add-on to an existing Volto project to test using this repo from the git source URL.

**Note**: You must also install the [backend add-on](https://github.com/Faakhir30/plone.workflowmanager/) to make this work.

## Test installation

Visit http://localhost:3000/ in a browser, login, visit site-setup and check the awesome new features.
